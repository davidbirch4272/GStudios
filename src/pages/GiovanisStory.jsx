        <h1>The Real Story</h1>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
          Excerpts from Boston Globe, February 21, 1999 Author: Gloria Negri,
          Globe Staff In his search for freedom, Giovani Hoyos-Corrales traveled
          thousands of miles, mostly on foot, from his native Peru across 10
          Latin American countries, enduring hardship and hunger, fording rivers
          in water up to his neck, to start a new life in America. He still
          keeps the tattered shoes he made of fabric and tire rubber that took
          him on his eight-month odyssey. Now, after eight years of living what
          to all appearances has been an exemplary life in this country, albeit
          as an illegal alien, Hoyos-Corrales, is facing the possibility of
          being deported to Peru where he was persecuted for his political
          beliefs as a university student. Fearing for his safety should he
          return to Peru and having built a new life here, Hoyos-Corrales said
          he tried to legalize his status three years ago, but met
          insurmountable obstacles... On March 15, an immigration judge is
          scheduled to hear Hoyos-Corrales' petition for political asylum to
          remain in this country where he hopes, someday, to become a citizen.
          "It would be very dangerous for Giovani to return to Peru," said Brian
          O'Connor, an aide to former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II. "Giovani
          conceded to the court that he entered the country without the proper
          documents, but he was doing so because he was fleeing oppression in
          his native country and came to the United States seeking safe haven."
          Last August, Kennedy wrote the INS in support of Hoyos-Corrales'
          petition, noting that while in this country, Hoyos-Corrales "has been
          self-employed as a sculptor, paid taxes, and contributed to the
          community as a volunteer soccer coach." Said O'Connor, "If this case
          were judged by character and the contributions Giovani has made to the
          community, his work coaching children in soccer and his redevelopment
          of a huge building in Everett that has made space for other artists to
          work, it would be closed." With a background in the arts (he is both a
          drummer and a sculptor), Hoyos-Corrales makes gothic-style gargoyles,
          a symbol of protection of the home, that are sold at a Newbury Street
          shop, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Harvard Square, and around the
          country. He is self-taught in the art, he said, taking it up here to
          be self-sufficient.... He also played in an interdepartmental soccer
          tournament at MIT and organizes an international tournament for an
          annual summer event held here by the Peruvian community. Some 700
          Cambridge residents and friends have signed a petition begging the INS
          to let him stay here. "He has worked hard to build a life here,
          working and developing his artistic skills as a sculptor," the
          petition says. "Many of us see Giovani as an inspiration, on both a
          personal and professional level. . . He is a symbol of a new
          generation of good immigrants in this country, and is an exemplary
          individual whom we, as American citizens, would like to see become a
          legal resident." In the late 1980s, as a student of economics at
          Peru's Universidad Inca Garcilaso de la Vega in Lima, Hoyos-Corrales,
          like many of his fellow students, disagreed with the ruling party, El
          Partido Aprista, on many social issues and what was best for the
          country. The party, he said, was rife with corruption and put forward
          economic "programs that were killing the country." `Inflation was 200
          percent," he said in a recent interview at his Cambridgeport
          residence. "People were begging in the streets. The party was
          destroying the country." El Partido Aprista, then headed by President
          Alan Garcia Perez, also ran the college he attended, Hoyos-Corrales
          said, and he was often interrogated and arrested for his views and was
          detained after a student rally he had not attended. "I couldn't live
          like that," he said. "I was not against the democratically elected
          government, but it was weak. They imposed a curfew and you could be
          accused of being a terrorist only if you had a different view of
          government." A Peruvian Human Rights Commission report in 1990 said
          3,198 people were killed there in political violence in 1989. Garcia
          Perez is now living out of the country. Hoyos-Corrales was a marked
          man. He comes from a politically active family with a name well known
          in South America. His grandfather's brother, he said, head of the
          military from 1980 to 1985, was assassinated for his politics. On Nov.
          28, 1990, at age 24, after completing four years of the five-year
          course at Inca Garcilaso and being increasingly harassed,
          Hoyos-Corrales left Peru, his parents, and his siblings. With two
          suitcases, clothes and some small items to barter, and $25, he said,
          "I just walked away." The next eight months were to take him across
          Peru to Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El
          Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. The story of his journey, filled with
          adventure and daring, is worthy of a movie. "From home, I just walked
          to the highway and started hitchhiking," Hoyos-Corrales recalled. "I
          gave the truck driver a shirt." Enroute north and to the border of
          Ecuador, he said he was interrogated by the military, but let go. He
          got to Quito, Ecuador's capital, and then to the border of Colombia,
          giving his watch to a border guard to get across. He slept on streets,
          in gullies, at hostels, and on park benches. He subsisted on Coca Cola
          and bread. Sometimes, he met kindred spirits who invited him home for
          a meal and overnight shelter, or he took jobs in restaurants in return
          for meals. He stayed in Colombia more than three months and found
          friends among the artisans and musicians. There, he traveled to Cali,
          Medellin, Cartagena and Barranquilla on the coast. In Barranquilla,
          Hoyos-Corrales stowed away on a Filipino-registered freighter heading
          to Germany. He hid under the floorboards under a bed in an unoccupied
          cabin, but was found out two hours into the journey. "I could have
          been tossed overboard by the captain," Hoyos-Corrales recalled, "but,
          maybe because I had been working on the boat before it left port, he
          had a small boat take me back to Colombia." He said he never thought
          of returning to Peru. In Colombia, he got a job on another boat that
          got him to Panama, where he stayed nine days. His next destination was
          Costa Rica, the one country for which he had a visa. So, he rode buses
          and got a job in a restaurant of a Peruvian in exchange for food for
          about a month. A Sandinista he met at the restaurant offered to escort
          him across the Nicaraguan border. Hoyos-Corrales gave him a small
          radio. It was near the end of the Sandinista-Contra civil war in
          Nicaragua, and Hoyos-Corrales and his guide had to dodge bullets as
          they fled through the jungle, stopping for the night at the home of
          the Sandinista's mother. The next day, the two men walked another 10
          hours through the jungle. Then, Hoyos-Corrales walked, hitchhiked and
          swam to Honduras and El Salvador. In Salvador, a truck driver offered
          a ride but not until Hoyos-Corrales met him at a gas station in
          Guatemala. So, in water up to his neck, he crossed a river into
          Guatemala. The truck brought him to the Mexican border. In Mexico with
          no documents (he had left his passport in Guatemala) he had to go
          through a number of immigration controls. He said he used a library
          card from Peru as identification. After eight months, with rides from
          drivers of banana and fish trucks and dressed as a Mexican peasant, he
          was finally able to board a bus to US soil, arriving in El Paso. From
          there, he took a Greyhound bus to Boston where he had a high school
          friend. "That," Hoyos-Corrales said somewhat wistfully of his
          undocumented arrival, "was the only bad thing I have done."
